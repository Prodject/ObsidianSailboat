Nmap and NSE command line wrapper

# the vision
A tool that integrates a bunch of NSE scripts together to build a picture of a host that we can reason over and discover various properties. I got sick of either losing data about hosts (dropping it on the floor), wrapping glue code to bridge from one tool to another, and the tons of boilerplate calls I make to various NSE scripts.

This is designed to couple to tools like recon-ng, SET, metasploit, and w3af for discovery, mapping, and footprinting.
